            <p>For a microbiology major, most universities typically require one semester of calculus, usually referred to as "Calculus I", which covers basic concepts like derivatives and integrals; some programs may require additional calculus depending on the specific focus of the major or if you plan to pursue graduate studies in microbiology. 
                Key points about math in microbiology:
                Calculus is the primary math requirement:
                Most microbiology programs will require students to take at least one semester of calculus. 
                Focus on applications:
                The calculus used in microbiology is often applied to biological systems, such as modeling population growth curves of bacteria. 
                Statistics may also be important:
                Depending on the program, you may need to take introductory statistics courses alongside calculus, as data analysis is a crucial aspect of microbiology research</p>
